# Audio_steganography_Phase_coding_modified_method
Phase coding is an audio steganography method. Here you can see the application of the modified method. 

When I was about to start writing my thesis work, I could not find well-defined documentation on the phase coding method.
It was obvious that every serious steganographic resource had to be hidden from people.
I've found the most well-defined source: https://studfile.net/preview/7379018/page:47/ but it's not complete.
The steps of the classic method that I modified/skiped is in the program comments.
The program can hide and find a maximum of 8 characters exactly. This is because of the double type precision.
Program works with "wav" files. "glass.wav" is a short audio file for running this program.

P.S. I'm open to discussion but, please, remember one thing: I don't have any idea about my yesterday code :D
